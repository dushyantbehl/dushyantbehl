### Hi there 👋

👋 👋 I’m Dushyant.

- 🔭 I work as a Software Engineer at IBM Research on multi cloud networking and observability. My current work focuses on multi cloud network observability and I contribute to [Openshift Network Observability](https://github.com/netobserv).

- 🌱 I'm also a part of [ebpfDevSecOps](https://github.com/eBPFDevSecTools) organization where we develop tools and frameworks to help developers and operators maintain the lifecycle of their eBPF programs, providing correctness and safety guarantees that enables confident adoption and deployment of 3rd party eBPF programs. 

- 👯 I am open to collaborate on [ebpfDevSecOps](https://github.com/eBPFDevSecTools) and ebpf in general.

- 💬 More information about me can be found on my [IBM Research page](https://research.ibm.com/people/dushyant-behl).
